= SimpleRestart =
Version 1.0.0 (Initial release) by FuzzyWuzzie!

== Description ==
SimpleRestart is a plugin for Bukkit (a Minecraft server wrapper) which allows server
operators to simply and easily reboot their server, as well as schedule automatic reboots
of the server "for freshness". The plugin contains flexible yet straightforward commands,
is easy to set up and use, and makes use of Permissions.

== Setting Up ==
Simply copy SimpleRestart.jar and the SimpleRestart folder into the "plugins" subdirectory
of your minecraft server. If you do not copy in the SimpleRestart folder, it will be created
for you automatically, along with a default configuration file. Edit the configuration file
(config.yml) as you see fit, then modify your server startup script so that it automatically
reboots the server when it gets "/stop"ped.

=== The Configuration File ===
The default configuration file is mostly straight forward and contains numerous comments.
However, each option is detailed below:
	* auto-restart: enable / disable automatic, time-scheduled restarting. If this is set
	  to "no" then the server will only ever restart when using the "/restart" command.
	* auto-restart-interval: this is how often (in hours) the server will automatically
	  restart itself (only if auto-restart is set to "yes")
	* warn-time: Before the server restarts, it will send out a friendly warning to all
	  connected players, this setting describes the amount of time (in minutes) before the
	  server automatically reboots that players are warned.
	* warning-message: this is the message that will be displayed as a warning that the
	  server will be restarting soon. You may use classic minecraft server colour codes
	  (http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Classic_server_protocol#Color_Codes) and "%t"%
	  to indicate how long before the server reboots. For example:
		warning-message: "&cServer will be restarting in %t minutes!"
	  will display "Server will be restarting in 5 minutes!" in red (with warn-time = 5)
	* restart-message: this is the message that players will see when they are kicked
	  from the server due to the automatic reboot. Again, colour codes can be used here.

=== Editing Your Startup Script ===
In order for this plugin to work properly, you will have to make a slight modification to
your startup script (Server.bat on windows, minecraft.sh on Linux). This plugin works by
simply scheduling regular "stops" of the server. Then when the server goes down, the
startup script simply loops around and starts the server up again, with minimal mumbo-jumbo.

This is accomplished in the startup scripts using infinite loops:
	* For Windows, put ":start" on the line before what you want repeated, then "goto start"
	  on the line after what you want repeated to make an infinite loop. Example Server.bat:
			@ECHO OFF
			SET BINDIR=%~dp0
			CD /D "%BINDIR%"
			:start
			"%ProgramFiles%\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe" -Xincgc -Xmx1G -jar craftbukkit-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
			goto start
	* For Linux, put "while true" <new line> "do" on the lines before what you want repeated,
	  and "done" on the line after to make an infinite loop. Example minecraft.sh:
			#!/bin/sh
			BINDIR="\$(dirname "\$(readlink -fn "\$0")")"
			cd "\$BINDIR"
			while true
			do
				java -Xincgc -Xmx1G -jar craftbukkit-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
			done
			
On Windows, to exit this infinite loop (i.e., take the server down for good), simply close the
command window. On Linux, press "Ctrl+C" to cancel the process.

== Permissions Nodes ==
To use anything in the /restart or /reboot commands, users must have the permission "simplerestart.restart"
To use the /memory command, users must have the permission "simplerestart.memory"

== Commands ==
(all commands may be typed in the console (without the "/" of course) or by players in-game)
(/restart and /reboot are synonyms for each other and can be used interchangeably)
	* /restart help: gives a simple help menu
	* /restart now: restarts the server immediately
	* /restart time: informs you how much time is left before the server restarts
	* /restart (h|m|s) <time>: turns automatic restarting on (if it was off) and reschedules the next
		automatic restart to be <time> (hours, minutes, or seconds) away from now. For example,
		to reboot the server in 15 minutes, use "/restart m 15". 'h' is for hours, 'm' is for minutes,
		and 's' is for seconds.
	* /restart on: turns automatic restarting on (if disabled in configuration OR via
		commands. Will start the scheduler from the current time based on the settings
		in the configuration.
	* /restart off: cancels any pending automatic restarts and prevents automatic restarts
		from happening until re-enabled
	* /memory: displays the java runtime memory usage, useful for catching runaway plugins
